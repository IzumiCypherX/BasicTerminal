    Basic Terminal 
</h1>

An extremely lightweight minimal terminal aimed at making understanding code easier.
Most terminals are loaded with features and a newbie won't understand how what's working. 
So here's this terminal, featuring only **one** base file, along with a PKGBUILD for easy installation.

## Purpose
The main Purpose of this is not luxury, but minimalism better understanding of how the code works at a base level
This is mostly an Educational Project, where you can playaround with the code!

Contributions are **welcomed**. 

## Installation & Running
```bash
izumi@arch:~$ git clone https://github.com/IzumiCypherX/BasicTerminal.git
izumi@arch:~$ cd BasicTerminal
izumi@arch:~$ makepkg -si 
izumi@arch:~$ basic-terminal
```

Or here's an one-liner, for both building and lauching the instance for the first time
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IzumiCypherX/BasicTerminal.git && cd BasicTerminal && makepkg -si && basic-terminal
```
>*sudo previleges are needed for building the package*
